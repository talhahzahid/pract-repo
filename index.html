    <h1> Muhammad Amir </h1>
        <p>Mohammad Amir (Urdu: محمد عامر; born 13 April 1992) is a former Pakistani cricketer and bowler for the Pakistan national cricket team. He was a left-arm fast bowler and a left handed batsman. He retired from international cricket in 2020 aged 28.[3][4] He was a member of the Pakistan team that won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.

            Amir made his first-class debut in November 2008, and his first One-Day International and Test appearances in July 2009 in Sri Lanka at the age of 17. He played his first international match during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, helping the national side win the tournament.[5][6] Eight years later in England, he helped Pakistan win the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, and was a major contributor with the ball in the final, getting the major wickets of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Shikhar Dhawan.
            
            On 29 August 2010, he was arrested for spot-fixing and was given a five-year ban for bowling two deliberate no-balls. Amir pleaded guilty on the verdict handed out by his prosecutor in the International Cricket Council, and publicly asked for forgiveness.[7] In November 2011, Amir was convicted at Southwark Crown Court, along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif, of conspiracy charges relating to spot-fixing and spent three months in prison. His ban was considered lenient, due to his juvenile age and confession, as compared to the other two conspirators who were given seven and 10 years' suspensions, effectively ending their careers.[8]</p>
